You decided to commit to operation starfall,good choice.

you go over the the segin squad base and you meet a figure that oddly looks to be the director but with a really bad pomadour,he introduces himself as clive and he offers you help you out.

you see a grunt at the gate  of the base and they challage you to a battle!
