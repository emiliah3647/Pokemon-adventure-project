You go to the base and after a very hard fight with Giacomo,you beat him yay!!!

he tells you about the team and that they orginally had a sucessful mission about a year and a half ago.

it's hard to explain but he gives you the dark badge!

the director of this operation,cassiopeia,gives you some points for helping and sends over a member to give you some supply for your quest!

[onto the next member we go!]()
