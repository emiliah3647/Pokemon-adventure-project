After leaving Arven to his  homemade subway's bar, you head on over to the asado desert,there are a lot of Pokemon.among the tinkatink,the capsakid's,and the Flittle.you see a elephant run to you in the distances.

is that another pokemon?never seen that in the pokedex...

you see it as a donphant but with a lot more hair and spikes.

it's a great tusk about to tramble you and or kill you.
